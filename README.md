## Introduction

This repository serves as a personal portfolio and a learning resource. By solving problems on LeetCode and documenting the solutions in Jupyter Notebooks, I aim to improve my problem-solving skills and provide a resource for others who are learning to code.

## Structure

Each LeetCode problem has its own directory containing a Jupyter Notebook. The directory and notebook are named after the problem for easy reference.
